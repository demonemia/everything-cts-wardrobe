The easiest way to get started with Wardrobe is by using a previously saved outfit from your viewer as the base for a new outfit in Wardrobe. Most of the work is already done for you when you save the outfit, we just need a picture and to make sure the outfit components are in a place where Wardrobe can find them

In this section you will learn how to:

- quickly enable dressing and undressing with any saved outfit through the Wardrobe interface. 
- create a base outfit which can be used to simplify the dressing and undressing process.

## Getting Started

Second Life stores your saved outfits in your Inventory in a folder called My Outfits. Each outfit you have saved is listed as a sub-folder of the My Outfits folder. You can follow along with these steps by selecting any saved outfit in your inventory to set up in Wardrobe. I will be using an outfit called Test Outfit for the demonstration. 

If you have not already enabled RLV and created an RLV folder please read through the guide on [[Setting up RLV]] before continuing with this section.

>[!note] Tip
>When you save an outfit in Second Life the viewer creates a link to each object, attachment and layer you are wearing and saves them to a subfolder in My Outfits. These links can be copied or moved into the RLV folder for use in Wardrobe. We will copy them as part of this example, but once you are more comfortable with Wardrobe you should move them to avoid the duplication in your inventory.

## Moving an Outfit to Wardrobe

### Creating an folder for our new outfit

1. Open your inventory in Second Life
2. Locate your RLV folder and **Right Click**
3. Select **New Folder** from the menu and **Type Outfits**
4. Locate the newly created Oufits folder and **Right Click**
5. Select **New Folder** from the menu and **Type** the name of the outfit you want to add

> After this step you will have a new Outfits folder inside of your RLV folder that can be used to store all outfits going forward. In addition you will have a new sub-folder for the specific outfit you are working on.

### Copying the outfit to our outfit folder

1. Open your inventory in Second Life
2. Locate your My Outfits folder and click the arrow to expand
3. Locate the folder for the outfit you want to set up in Wardrobe, and click the arrow to expand the folder.
4. Left click the first item in the list of links for your outfit.
5. Press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard and the Left Click the last link for your outfit. This will select all of the links that make up your outfit.
6. Right click on the selected files and select copy.
7. Locate your RLV folder again, and find the outfit folder we created earlier.
8. Right Click on the folder you created for your outfit, in my case Test Outfit, and select Paste.

> After this step you will have a copy of all of the links that make up a single outfit inside of a folder in RLV. All items that you want to wear with Wardrobe must be inside of the RLV folder to be worn.
   
### Saving a Photo

One of the requirements for any Wardrobe entry is a photogrpah. The simplest way to get a photo of your outfit is to use the Wardrobe pose stand and the viewers built in snapshot capability. If you are uncertain how to rez a copy of the Wardrobe pose stand please read [[The Wardrobe HUD]].

Each Second Life viewer is a little different when it comes to taking and saving a snapshot. Please refer to the instructions for your viewer on how to take a snapshot. You want to use the Save to Disk option to freely save the image you take to your local computer. Keep track of where the file is saved so you can locate it later. 

When you take your snapshot, you will be given the option to set the width and height of the picture. You should also see an Constrain proportions check box. Uncheck the box if needed, and set both the width and height to 512. The format can be either PNG or JPG.

### Creating our Wardrobe entry

Lastly we will create a new entry in Wardrobe that references the outfit folder we created, Test Outfit for this demonstration. The most important rule of creating Wardrobe entries is that the Title in our Wardrobe entry must match the name of the folder in our inventory that holds our outfit exactly. 

#### Copy Outfit Folder Name

1. Locate the outfit folder you created
2. Right click the folder and select Rename
3. Press Ctrl/Cmd + C on your keyboard to Copy the exact name of your folder.

#### Add Entry in Wardrobe

1. Navigate to your Wardrobe web page in your browser of choice.
2. Click the Add Items button on the tool bar. (if you don't see Add Items refer to [[The Wardrobe Web Page]] article)
3. Right Click in the Title field and select Paste.
4. Click in the Tags field and type Outfit
5. Click in the remarks field and type a short description of this outfit

#### Add Picture to the Entry

1. Click the Elipsis button in the Images section
2. Navigate your computer to the location where you saved the snapshot
3. Click the snapshot and click Open

#### Submiting the Entry

1. Visually verify that you have completed each section.
2. Double check that the title in Wardrobe exactly matches the folder in inventory.
3. Click the Submit button
