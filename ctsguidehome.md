# the definitive guide to cts wardrobe

One of my greatest joys in Second Life has been using and helping others to learn to use CTS Wardrobe. Wardrobe is a set of scripted tools (primarily a HUD and a cabinet), and associated web site which can be used to visualize your inventory of clothing and more. Not only can it help you to visualize the things you have bought, you can also wear and remove clothing by leveraging the RLV functionality found in most Third Party Viewers in Second Life.

My hope is that this resource will continue to help people learn and become experts in Wardrobe moving forward.

With Wardrobe you can:

- Create a visual catalog of everything you own in Second Life.
- Automate dressing and undressing with RLV
- Create entries individual items (a skirt or a new pair of shoes)
- Create entries for entire saved outfit
